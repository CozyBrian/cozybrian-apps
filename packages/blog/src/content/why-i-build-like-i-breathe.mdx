summary: "A deep dive into why I code the way I do."

I’m not just a developer — I’m a **problem solver** with a <span className="text-cozy-300">toolbox</span> that spans from elegant frontends to bulletproof backends. Whether I’m crafting a clean SwiftUI interface, architecting a React Native app, or fine-tuning API performance, I approach every project with **precision, clarity, and a touch of artistry**.

## My Superpowers

- **Full Stack Fluency** — I speak both frontend and backend fluently, and I don’t need a translator.
- **Cross-Platform Wizardry** — Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android, React Native for both — I’ve done it.
- **Performance-Obsessed** — I believe speed is a feature, and I make it one.
- **UI/UX Focused** — Every pixel matters; every interaction should feel natural.

> 💡 *Fun fact:* I once reduced a query time from **3s** to **120ms**.

function test() {
  console.log("This is a test function");
}
```

### Java Example

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("This is a test function in Java");
    }
}
```

## The Way I Work

When I take on a project, I don’t just write code — I **design experiences**. I think deeply about the user’s journey, the product’s purpose, and the long-term maintainability of the codebase.  
I’ve led teams, built CI/CD pipelines, optimized databases, and launched products that *just work* — even under pressure.
